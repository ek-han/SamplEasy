What do Kanye’s All Falls Down, Dua Lipa’s Love Again, and Beyonce’s Break My Soul have in common? They’re all critically acclaimed songs– that recycle sounds from less popular songs! This practice, called sampling, is an essential tool for record producers, especially in the dominant genres of pop and hip hop. But, aspiring producers just don’t have the money to buy the rights to sample popular songs and are always looking for more obscure records that’ll set their music apart from the crowd. Unlike most music search applications that show only popular music, SamplEasy allows the user to search the Spotify database for the most obscure songs of their preferred genre, tempo, and key. Sample searching has never been easier!
